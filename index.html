He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied <i>physics and aerospace engineering</i>. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the <i>Defence Research and Development Organisation </i>(DRDO) and <i>Indian Space Research Organisation </i>(ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military <b>missile development efforts</b>. He thus came to be known as the<b style="color: red;"> Missile Man of India</b> for his work on the development of <b>ballistic missile</b> and <b>launch vehicle technology</b>.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's <b>Pokhran-II </b>nuclear tests in 1998, <i>the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974</i>.
                Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the <b>"People's President"</b>, he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
